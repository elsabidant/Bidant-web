        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
          Fictional narratives have long been debated as serving either a
          <strong>cognitive function</strong>, helping individuals simulate
          possible futures and rehearse responses to uncertain situations, or a
          purely <strong>entertainment-driven function</strong>, relying on
          exaggerated cues that humans are already predisposed to enjoy, such as
          threat, dominance, romance, or technological power. This opposition is
          commonly framed as a contrast between the
          <strong>simulation hypothesis</strong> and the
          <strong>entertainment hypothesis</strong>.

          <br /><br />

          A key implication of this debate is the possibility of a
          <strong>structural trade-off</strong>
          between predictive accuracy and entertainment value. Narratives that
          aim to anticipate the future accurately must remain constrained by
          plausible mechanisms and known regularities, which may limit the
          exaggeration, surprise, and emotional intensity that often drive
          audience engagement. Conversely, stories that depart from realism can
          amplify rewarding stimuli, functioning as superstimuli that enhance
          enjoyment but reduce predictive fidelity.

          <br /><br />

          <strong>Science-fiction cinema</strong> provides a privileged testing
          ground for this question, as it explicitly projects future
          technologies, social transformations, and global threats. This study
          investigates whether science-fiction films that
          <strong>more accurately anticipate</strong>
          real future developments are
          <strong>less commercially successful</strong>, as predicted by the
          entertainment hypothesis, or whether anticipatory accuracy instead
          contributes positively to cultural and economic success.

          The study relies on the IMDb dataset of movies released between 1931
          and 2019. The initial sample includes
          <strong>1,455 science-fiction films</strong> with basic metadata
          (title, plot, year of release, genre, language, worldwide gross
          income, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          For the analysis, we restrict the sample to films with a non-missing
          worldwide box office, resulting in N = 588 movies. In addition, we
          merge this dataset with the IMDb Movies Dataset from Kaggle to obtain
          budget information, yielding a final analytical sample of
          <strong>N = 360</strong> films.

        <p class="annotation-intro">
          We rely on an automatic annotation procedure powered by GPT-5.2 to
          compute an holistic measure of anticipatory accuracy. GPT is asked
          directly how much a past film anticipates the present, yielding a
          <strong>continuous score from 0 to 5</strong>.

              score from 0 to 5, where <br />
              0 = no resemblance to later real developments; <br />
              1 = extremely vague or coincidental resemblance; <br />
              2 = limited partial anticipation with few identifiable parallels;
              <br />
              3 = moderate anticipation with several partial or general
              parallels; <br />
              4 = strong anticipation with multiple meaningful and relatively
              precise correspondences;<br />
              5 = exceptional anticipation with numerous specific, accurate, and
              well-defined parallels to later real-world developments.

          An alternative annotation procedure was implemented at an early stage
          of the project, relying on a claim-based strategy (see Devlog). The
          anticipatory accuracy scores derived from this procedure converged
          with those obtained using the current annotation protocol, suggesting
          that the measurement is robust to reasonable variations in annotation
          strategy.

        <h2>Analysis method</h2>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
          To test our hypothesis, we compute a
          <strong> multivariate linear regression </strong> that models the
          cultural success (approximated by the worldwide gross income) based on
          the year and the accuracy of future prediction.<br />
          The regression uses the following formula :
        </p>
        <p class="equation">
          log(Box office<sub>i</sub>) = β<sub>0</sub> +
          β<sub>1</sub>·Accuracy<sub>i</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>·log(Budget)<sub
            >i</sub
          >
          + β<sub>3</sub>·Year<sub>i</sub> + ε<sub>i</sub>
        </p>

        <p>
          We focus on a one-sided (left-tailed) test on β<sub>1</sub>, asking
          whether higher anticipation accuracy is associated with lower
          box-office revenue.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p>
          The main coefficient of interest,
          <strong>anticipatory accuracy</strong>, shows a
          <strong>positive and statistically significant</strong> association
          with box-office performance (<em>β<sub>1</sub></em> = 0.213). The
          conventional two-sided p-value for this effect is
          <strong><em>p</em> < 0.001</strong>. However, the left-tailed p-value
          is <strong><em>p</em> = 0.999</strong>. This result provides
          <strong>no support</strong> for the pre-registered directional
          hypothesis that more accurate films would be less commercially
          successful.

          <br /><br />

          By contrast, the <strong>right-tailed p-value</strong> is
          <strong><em>p</em> < 0.001</strong>, indicating strong evidence in
          favor of a <strong>positive relationship</strong> between anticipatory
          accuracy and box-office revenue.

          <br /><br />

          Among the control variables,
          <strong>production budget</strong> emerges as a strong and highly
          significant predictor of box-office revenue (<em>β<sub>2</sub></em> =
          0.450, <em>p</em> < 0.001). In contrast, the effect of
          <strong>release year</strong> is not statistically significant in this
          model (<em>β<sub>3</sub></em> = 0.061, <em>p</em> = 0.206), suggesting
          that temporal trends are largely accounted for by differences in
          budget and film characteristics.

          <br /><br />

          Overall, the model explains a meaningful share of the variance in
          box-office performance (<em>R²</em> = 0.241), indicating that
          approximately 24% of the variation in revenue is accounted for by
          anticipatory accuracy, production budget, and release year.

          and instead support the <strong>simulation hypothesis</strong>:

          developments tend to achieve
          <strong>greater commercial success</strong>. Rather than indicating a
          trade-off between realism and popularity, anticipatory accuracy
          appears to function as a <strong>positive contributor</strong> to
          cultural and economic outcomes in this sample.
